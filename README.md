# Feature-Imitating-Networks

TASK 1: First, I would like you to train two feature imitating networks that take as input a fixed length sequence and provide as output (1) the mean and (2) the standard deviation of a fixed length input; a deep feedforward architecture should be sufficient for this.

TASK 2: Next, I would like you to train two feature imitating networks that take as input an arbitrary length sequence and provide as output (1) the mean and (2) the standard deviation of the sequence; a LSTM, or other recurrent architecture should be sufficient for this. 

TASK 3: Next, I would like you to train one feature imitating network that takes as input an arbitrary length sequence, and provides both the mean and standard deviation of that sequence; an LSTM or other recurrent architecture with multiple outputs should be sufficient for this task.
